    <p class="bio">	I began my academic journey in Brooklyn, New York. The school was Public School 284, directly across the street from my grandmother’s apartment in the Langston Hughes projects. There, my grandmother instilled in me the characteristics of discipline that would lead me to a somewhat successful academic career and a few notable secular achievements as well. There was never an off day for my grandmother. Rain, sleet or snow, we had to go to school. Perfect attendance was a mediocre achievement with my Grandmother. You see, attendance is a given but it was the privilege of a free education that my grandmother valued. It is quite an epiphany to credit my wise old grandmother with but in the very least she is the catalyst that galvanized my spirit to soar and to achieve academically.

	 It was at this school that I learned I had a gift. In kindergarten, I was well advanced. At the ripe young age of three, I was already reading. Subsequently, they advanced me to the second grade. This had later proven to be a disadvantage, as all of the other children were more mature than myself. Everyone was older, bigger and faster. I had a hard time adjusting to school life. Later on, they asked my mother if she would consent to advancing me another grade because my grades were very high and I was proving to be too advanced for the third grade also. My mother reluctantly refused. She witnessed what I was experiencing from the first advance, the struggles to fit in. I credit my mother for that decision because of how hard it must have been for her to juxtapose an opportunity for me to glimmer academically with my abilities and my inability to adjust socially and to interact with the other school children, regardless of age and size.

	In the fourth grade, my family moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and I had to adjust once again. This time it was to be to an entirely new school, let alone new grade level. There was no room for me in the advanced classes where I belonged so I was placed in a remedial class. It was difficult, but I learned all the same.

	The next year, my school had undergone a controversial change. It had become a Magnet School for the gifted and intellectual. Many students were forced to go to other schools out of their respective zones but I was fortunate enough to qualify and meet the requirements. I succeeded in that school, learning a lot about who I was and what talents I possessed. I took up acting and starred in our schools production of West Side Story. The science lab gave me my affinity for the sciences and the computer lab taught me about the stock market and how money grows. Overall, I learned a great deal at this school and upon graduation I was voted most likely to succeed from The Clara Cardwell School for The Gifted and Intellectual.

	When the time came to graduate and choose a high school, I had many options present. My family wanted me to choose the path of academia with Brooklyn Technical High School because I had passed the entrance exam. I chose, however, the path of the arts and elected to go to Art & Design High School instead, a standardized school for the fine arts and design. I did not perform to my level in high school, barely graduating on time and with a significantly low G.P.A. for my standards. Nevertheless, I again learned much about who I was as a person and more importantly, as an individual. I excelled in sports, playing varsity baseball for the school team and was elected Captain of the team in my sophomore year. I developed a style as an artist and also gained an appreciation for the arts in general. Overall, high school was a wonderful experience that I would gladly repeat. Of course this time, though, as valedictorian or at least with better grades.

	Upon graduation from high school, the time was at hand to start thinking about a future. I was unsure about what direction to take and because of this my growth was stagnated. I wasted a significant amount of time with petty sales jobs that promised no future. When I finally realized that I was wasting valuable time, I set a game plan to become a New York City Police Officer.  I knew that my chances were ominously greater if I had military experience so I opted to join the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Corps was, without question, the greatest decision I have ever made in my life thus far. Not only did they teach me the value of discipline and the importance of living ones life by a certain code, I learned about respect and admiration for good leadership, teamwork and honor. After a successful tour with the Marines, it was time to fulfill the second important prerequisite for joining the NYPD. A college education would greatly increase my chances, coupled with military experience. I chose John Jay College of criminal justice. After obtaining enough credits to suffice NYPD standards, I took the city-administered exam for police officer. I wound up scoring the highest score in my class. All was lined up for me to join New York’s finest but I unfortunately failed the psychological examination and as a result I had to make changes to my future plans.

	I wasted a significant amount of my youth with lascivious partying and chasing false dreams. When I finally decided to get serious about my future I moved back to New York and registered at the College of Staten Island to obtain my bachelors degree. At the College of Staten Island I excelled academically, graduating with a B average. I participated in many extracurricular activities, such as student government as a senator and journalism, writing for “The Banner”, CSI’s school newspaper. Although I have my Bachelors of Science in communications I do not work in my field. Currently, I am paying the bills as a chef working at The Landmarc, a New York City restaurant, bar and grill.

	I intend on obtaining my Masters Degree at Columbia University in an attempt to further my education and also start a successful career in my field of study. An opportunity to further my education at Columbia University is the extent of the audacity of my hope, (to paraphrase President Barak Obama). One of my assets as well as my flaws is that I dare to dream big. I will not have another opportunity to go back and start High School from the beginning but there is nothing wrong with applying my raging passion towards a Masters Degree at the prestigious Columbia University. It’s what my epiphany, my Grandmother, would have wanted. After all, she dedicated her life to the study of religion and theology, totally shunning secular academia and higher learning, to which she would have greatly succeeded, undoubtedly. My Grandmother knew that this time would come. She always wanted more for me, her first-born grandson. The time has come for me to take my talent and work harder than I ever have before. The time has come for me to want more for myself.
