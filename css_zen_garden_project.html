    <p class="differences">What I look for in a great website is primarily a user-friendly interface and a clean, welcoming design. A site that is easy to navigate while  easy and fun to look at is my idea of a great website. Taking this into consideration,  of the websites surveyed on CSS Zen Garden, I have chosen both a website that I really enjoyed and a website that I felt was poorly designed.

The website that I enjoyed very much was “Zen Pool”. The design of the website should incorporate several elements, one being the name of the site itself. That being said, Zen Pool’s design is of a cool, crisp looking swimming pool in the summertime, which gives the user a calm feeling of being at the pool in the summer and thus making them feel relaxed. Secondly, the site was easy to navigate. The categories were neatly displayed on the left in a list style design. This style is seen in many websites that have multiple categories to choose from, which makes selection of the needed categories simple. When using firebug to view the coding, being that I am a novice at CSS Styles, all I could see was that the styles sheet was  in order.  As far as understanding or deciphering the coding, well I could use a few more classes before what I say would make any sense. The coding, however inexperienced I am, was clean and in order and there were several tags that I did notice, which was very encouraging.

The website that I did not like very much was that of “Defiance”. Although I said that a website should incorporate the name or it’s mission in it’s design, for the Defiance website, this advice did not bode to well. I felt as though, as far as the design aspect is concerned, the website was sloppy. Furthermore, the website was difficult to manage because of the flawed design. As far as the coding is concerned, the same applies as did for the CSS Zen Pool website. When I looked at the coding, there were more unfamiliar than familiar terms. The thing I noticed about both websites alike in terms of coding was how streamlined and neat the coding was. It was as neat as an English paragraph, except for the multi-colored text. What I noticed that was different from my coding and that of these two website was a tag called “blockquote” and also how my coding indents and goes to the right with every line whereas there’s, as I pointed out before, is streamlined and neat like an English paragraph. This exercise was very useful in that it taught me how and the benefits of using the program “Firebug” and to aim at having a neat, CSS styles sheet for my websites in the future.
